## Why Our Cheat Obliterates the Competition 💥

Most loaders slap on generic offsets and pray. We built a **bespoke injector engine** that lives inside a sandboxed process, shuffling signatures every spawn. The result? Zero detections, buttery frames, and a legit-looking recoil pattern that fools both eye-ball reviewers and kernel watchdogs. Pair that with lightning turn-around updates and you’ve got the only cheat ready before the devs finish their hotfix tweet.
